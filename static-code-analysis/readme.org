Some static analysis of grammar/lisp/*.el
Oct 4-8, 2015
* defun, defun1
Preliminary versions.
* defuna.txt
Focus on 'defun' and 'defvar'
Show all functions with parameter lists.
Order by module.
python defuna.py 1 ../grammar/lisp defuna.txt 
* limitations of lisp parsing
Parse lisp using an extension of sexp.py.
The parsing is imperfect. Problem areas are
 comments, strings, and array literals.
 A more perfect parsing is difficult.
 See scratch.el for first exploration of parsing Elisp with Elisp.
* defuna_xref.txt
extract function cross-references.  The results are ordered by 
module (lisp .el file) and sub-ordered by number of callers.
python defuna.py 2 ../grammar/lisp defuna_xref.txt
* defuna_xref_module.txt
For each module, show the functions in other modules that are called within
the given module.  Thus, shows the module dependencies.
python defuna.py 3 ../grammar/lisp defuna_xref_module.txt

* THE END
