Comparing conjugations generated by SanskritVerb to conjugations
generated by Pysanskrit.

## map Sanverb conjugation tables
This step facilitates the comparison of conjugations, by taking into account
differences in the spelling of roots.

See sanverb/readme.md for discussion.  
## Generate pysan conjugations, present tense

```
python pysan_pre.py sanverb/conj_pre_map1.txt data/pysan_conj_pre.txt
```

Programming note: The program reads only the header from Dhaval's conjugation
tables, and in fact can read any file which has such a header on each line.
The header is of the form:
```
aMs pre 10A
```

By using Dhaval's root,class,pada information, we effectively ignore the
differences involved in matching Dhaval's dhatupatha and the pseudo-dhatupatha
implied by MW.

## compare SanskritVerb and pysan present tense conjugations **

```
python compare_conj_tables.py sanverb/conj_pre_map1.txt data/pysan_conj_pre.txt data/compare_conj_pre.txt
```
