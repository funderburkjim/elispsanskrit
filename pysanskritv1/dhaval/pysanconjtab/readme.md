pysanskritv1/dhaval/pysanconjtab

Comparing conjugations generated by SanskritVerb to conjugations
generated by Pysanskrit.

## Generate pysan conjugations, present tense

```
python pysan_pre.py ../conjtab/mapped/conj_pre_map1.txt data/pysan_conj_pre.txt
```

Programming note: The program reads only the header from Dhaval's conjugation
tables, and in fact can read any file which has such a header on each line.
The header is of the form:
```
aMs pre 10A
```

By using Dhaval's root,class,pada information, we effectively ignore the
differences involved in matching Dhaval's dhatupatha and the pseudo-dhatupatha
implied by MW.

** compare SanskritVerb and pysan present tense conjugations **
