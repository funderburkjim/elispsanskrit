This is a revision of elispsanskrit/pysanskrit.
The focus is on resolving the conjugation algorithms in light of the
forms generated by Dhaval Patel's work.

## Dhaval's work: conjtab

This directory contains extracts of conjugation tables from the list of
inflected forms from SanskritVerb. 

Refer also to the `readme` files in these directories:
* [conjtab](https://github.com/funderburkjim/elispsanskrit/blob/master/pysanskritv1/dhaval/conjtab/readme.md).
* [generatedforms](https://github.com/funderburkjim/elispsanskrit/blob/master/pysanskritv1/dhaval/generatedforms/readme.md).
* [function](https://github.com/funderburkjim/elispsanskrit/blob/master/pysanskritv1/dhaval/function/readme.md).
* [roots](https://github.com/funderburkjim/elispsanskrit/blob/master/pysanskritv1/dhaval/roots/readme.md).

## conj_pre.txt SanskritVerb present tense conjugations
These are extracted from the list of generated forms.

  ```
  aka! pre 01.0901P:[akati akataH akanti akasi akaTaH akaTa akAmi akAvaH akAmaH]
  akzU! pre 01.0742P:[(akzati akzRoti) (akzataH akzRutaH) (akzanti akzRuvanti) (akzasi akzRozi) (akzaTaH akzRuTaH) (akzaTa akzRuTa) (akzAmi akzRomi) (akzAvaH akzRuvaH) (akzAmaH akzRumaH)]

  ```
  * root with anubandhas
  * tense (pre for present tense)
  * gana.number and pada (Parasmaipada or Atmanepada)
  * conjugation table, in order 3s,3d,3p,2s,2d,2p,1s,1d,1p
    Parenthesized elements mean that multiple forms were found.
  * the root and gana.number are believed to be consistent with 
    dhaval/roots/verbdata.txt 
  * the pada is implied by the tense endings of the generated forms.

By construction (see dhaval/conjtab/extract.py), forms are put into the
same table based on the root+gana.number+pada.  Thus these 4 parameters
can be viewed as the de-facto inputs to the SanskritVerb conjugation
algorithms.


## root class pada lists

The pysanskrit algorithms for root conjugation depend on several factors:
* the root  (as spelled in Monier-Williams dictionary)
* the tense of the conjugation (present, imperfect, future, etc.)
* the class of the root (1 to 10)
* the voice (active, middle, passive). Active and middle voice are different
  grammatical terms for Parasmaipada and Atmanepada.
* The class is significant to the so-called special tenses (present, imperfect,
  imperative, optative).  Generally, the class is irrelevant to the other
  tenses, but, as of this writing, it is still used as an input for those
  other tenses.  *This is a point that needs to be clarified.*

From this review, we conclude that the required inputs for the conjugation
function (in a given tense) are only similar, but not identical.  These
differences must be taken into account in attempting a comparison of results
of the two systems.

## root-class-pada implied by SanskritVerb

In dhaval/function/verbdata.txt we have what is at least close to the
dhatupatha used by SanskritVerb.  One useful feature is the presence of
a spelling of each root *without* anubandha.  This can be used as a first
approximation proxy for the MW root spelling.   

```
aka!:kuwilAyAM gatO:ak:01:0901:pa:sew:अ॑कँ॑:488:512:517:ak1_akaz_BvAxiH+kutilAyAM_gawO:
aki!:lakzaRe:aNk:01:0092:A:sew:अ॑किँ॒:67:66:68:afk1_akiz_BvAxiH+lakRaNe:45
```

Also, in dhaval/conjtab/conj_pre.txt we have information that supplies
the pada (P,A).

The sanverb_cp program generates two lists of roots with class-padas
```
#in directory roots
python sanverb_cp.py ../dhaval/function ../dhaval/conjtab/conj_pre.txt conjtab_cp.txt sanverb_cp.txt > sanverb_cp_log.txt
```

sanverb_cp.txt gathers all its information from the verbdata.txt file.
conjtab_cp.txt uses the roots and padas from the extracted present tense
conjugations (conj_pre.txt); it finds the 'root without anubandha' spelling
by reference to verbdata.txt.

The two lists are quite similar, but with a few differences. The next program
compares the two lists.
```
python compare_cp.py sanverb conjtab sanverb_conjtab
```
The output file (sanverb_conjtab.txt) indicates
* 1581 cases where the root-class-pada information is identical
* 74 cases where roots are present in both sources, but the class-pada 
  information from conj_pre is less inclusive than that in verbdata
* 29 cases where a root is present only in verbdata, but has no present
  tense conjugation according to conj_pre.
