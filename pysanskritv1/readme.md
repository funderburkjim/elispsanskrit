This is a revision of elispsanskrit/pysanskrit.
The focus is on resolving the conjugation algorithms in light of the
forms generated by Dhaval Patel's work.

## Dhaval's work: conjtab

This directory contains extracts of conjugation tables from the list of
inflected forms from SanskritVerb. 

Refer also to the `readme` files in these directories:
* [conjtab](https://github.com/funderburkjim/elispsanskrit/blob/master/pysanskritv1/dhaval/conjtab/readme.md).
* [generatedforms](https://github.com/funderburkjim/elispsanskrit/blob/master/pysanskritv1/dhaval/generatedforms/readme.md).
* [function](https://github.com/funderburkjim/elispsanskrit/blob/master/pysanskritv1/dhaval/function/readme.md).
* [roots](https://github.com/funderburkjim/elispsanskrit/blob/master/pysanskritv1/dhaval/roots/readme.md).

## conj_pre.txt SanskritVerb present tense conjugations
These are extracted from the list of generated forms.

  ```
  aka! pre 01.0901P:[akati akataH akanti akasi akaTaH akaTa akAmi akAvaH akAmaH]
  akzU! pre 01.0742P:[(akzati akzRoti) (akzataH akzRutaH) (akzanti akzRuvanti) (akzasi akzRozi) (akzaTaH akzRuTaH) (akzaTa akzRuTa) (akzAmi akzRomi) (akzAvaH akzRuvaH) (akzAmaH akzRumaH)]

  ```
  * root with anubandhas
  * tense (pre for present tense)
  * gana.number and pada (Parasmaipada or Atmanepada)
  * conjugation table, in order 3s,3d,3p,2s,2d,2p,1s,1d,1p
    Parenthesized elements mean that multiple forms were found.
  * the root and gana.number are believed to be consistent with 
    dhaval/roots/verbdata.txt 
  * the pada is implied by the tense endings of the generated forms.

By construction (see dhaval/conjtab/extract.py), forms are put into the
same table based on the root+gana.number+pada.  Thus these 4 parameters
can be viewed as the de-facto inputs to the SanskritVerb conjugation
algorithms.


## root class pada lists

The pysanskrit algorithms for root conjugation depend on several factors:
* the root  (as spelled in Monier-Williams dictionary)
* the tense of the conjugation (present, imperfect, future, etc.)
* the class of the root (1 to 10)
* the voice (active, middle, passive). Active and middle voice are different
  grammatical terms for Parasmaipada and Atmanepada.
* The class is significant to the so-called special tenses (present, imperfect,
  imperative, optative).  Generally, the class is irrelevant to the other
  tenses, but, as of this writing, it is still used as an input for those
  other tenses.  *This is a point that needs to be clarified.*

From this review, we conclude that the required inputs for the conjugation
function (in a given tense) are only similar, but not identical.  These
differences must be taken into account in attempting a comparison of results
of the two systems.
