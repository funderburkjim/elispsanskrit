<h1><a id="Background_0"></a>Background</h1>
<p>A small number of roots in Gerard Huet’s inflected forms are spelled ending
in <code>a</code>, and are identified as conjugation class 11 (which we think indicates
that the root is a causal base; alternately, it may be a denominative.)</p>
<p>In either case, for this list of 36 verbs, there is a root  from the Monier-Williams dictionary that is spelled the same, except without the final <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>For each of these pairs of words, we want to make an informed guess
as to whether the MW verb and the Huet verb are <em>the same</em>.</p>
<p>This web form facilitates one way of making this informed guess.  Namely,
compare the dictionary entries in MW and Huet for corresponding verbs,
and if the senses align, then probably it is the case that the roots
correspond.</p>

<ol>
<li>click a case in the list to the left.</li>
<li>Compare the English definitions for the MW root to the French definitions for the Huet root.
<ul>
<li>Sometimes there is a definition for a noun, and then a definition for the root.  Focus on the root definition in Huet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the definitions of the roots agree, then click the <strong>Yes</strong> button and then the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</li>
<li>If the definitions disagree, then click the <strong>No</strong> button and then the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</li>
<li>If the definition comparison is uncertain, then click the <strong>Cannot Decide</strong> button, and then the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you click the <strong>Submit</strong> button, the case in the left will change color, from black (meaning the case hasn’t been done yet) to a color
red (No), green (Yes), orange (Uncertain).
</p>
<p>Even if a case has been done, you can review it again and change the solution.</p>

<li>All the cases are initially marked as <strong>No</strong>, the roots are different.</li>
<li>When you click ‘Submit’, the result is saved to the Cologne Server.</li>
<li>You can do the cases in different computer sessions.  When you start a new session, the previously done cases will be as last submitted.</li>
