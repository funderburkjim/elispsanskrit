The purpose is to compare Huet's inflected forms with those generated by
elispsanskrit/pysanskrit.

## interpret Huet's verb inflected forms, passive 

```
python verbs-prim-pas.py ../huet/SL_roots.xml huet_stems_passive.txt huet_conj_tables_passive.txt > verbs_log.txt
```

From Huet's SL_roots.xml file, we derive all roots for
which there is a passive conjugational form.


Programming note2: We made a couple of adjustments to huet's data to 
facilitate comparisons.
* Huet uses a convention for homonym representation. For example there 
  are two homonyms for `aja`, and these are distinguished as `aja#1` and
  `aja#2`.   
* We drop the homonym distinction, leaving just `aja`.

## generate pysan_stems_passive.txt

The data source is the list of verbs for MW in dcpforms-MW-verb.txt.
This program just collects the information in this file, and changes
format to that of huet_stems_passive.txt.
```
python pysan_stems_passive.py ../../grammar/prod/inputs/dcpforms-MW-verb.txt pysan_stems_passive.txt
```
## compare huet and pysan passive_stem data
```
python compare_stems_passive.py huet pysan compare
```
The output is compare_stems_passive.txt, which provides some analysis of the
similarities and differences between huet_stems_passive.txt and
pysan_stems_passive.txt

## Generate pysan conjugations

```
python pysan-prim-pas.py huet_conj_tables_passive.txt pysan_conj_tables_passive.txt
```
We read the huet conjugation tables, and for each one use the header
information to compute a pysan conjugation table.  


##  compare conjugation tables
```
python compare_conj_tables_passive.py huet pysan compare
```


## first summary

See [issue#8](https://github.com/funderburkjim/elispsanskrit/issues/8) for some discussion of the comparison.
