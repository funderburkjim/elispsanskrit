* Introduction
  Analysis of the Ramopakhyana data base file (MBhRamaGrammar.rtf)
  This file was provided by P. Scharf, and is closely related to his book.

  This file is referenced as an Emacs buffer by function call '(Mbh-buffer)'.
  The file is structured as a sequence of lines, and each line is 
  structured into fields (usually 7) separated by the tab character.
  There are 21130 lines, plus 2 blank lines.
  8609 records have no decimal point in field 2, and represent
     unanalyzed words, which may or may not be compounds.
  12521 records have a decimal point in field 2, and represent 
     analyses of compounds.
  All of the 8609 records have at least 6 fields  these records
  are put into buffer 'Mbhu-buffer', and it is this subset which
  receives further attention from the 'Mbhu-validate2' function as
  described below. In particular, line numbers mentioned are relative
  to this subset. For instance,
  'DIFF @line 372: paricArikAH f2p paricAraka noun' refers
  to line 372 of the 'Mbhu' file, but this is line 838 of 'MbhRamaGrammar.rtf';
  i.e., the 372nd unanalyzed record occurs on the 838th line.

* Lexical identifiers
  The 8609 records in 'Mbhu-buffer' were analyzed for the distribution of
  lexical identifiers in field 6; the result is in file  'Mbhu-lexid.txt'.
  This file has 243 lines, indicating 243 variants of lexical identifier.

* Mbhu-validate2
 The function call (Mbhu-validate2 LEX) performs a comparison between
 the explanation of grammatical form in the Mbhu file and the ejf 
 algorithms. A given invocation deals only with records filtered by 
 the LEX code.
 The following show the values of LEX employed:
 (Mbhu-validate2 "noun")
 (Mbhu-validate2 "adj")
 (Mbhu-validate2 "pron")
 (Mbhu-validate2 "card")
 (Mbhu-validate2 "ord")
 (Mbhu-validate2 "adjt")  (present active participle)
 (Mbhu-validate2 "V")  (conjugated verb)
 (Mbhu-validate2 "I")  (indeclinable)
 For the most part, the association is clear between LEX and the 243 variants 
 appearing as lexical identifier in field 6. 

 In general, the 'Mbhu-validate2' attempts to confirm the analysis (field 4)
  of the inflected form (field 3) given the base form (field 5) and the
  lexical identifier (field 6).  Where this confirmation is not possible,
  information is printed to allow further investigation of the difference.

 The following table summarizes application of 'Mbhu-validate2' for each of
 the lexical categories mentioned in the first column.
 The second column indicates the number of such records.  The third column
 indicates the number of those for which there was confirmation of the
 given analysis of the inflected form.

          #   #ok
  noun:  2871 2852  
  adj :  1636 1617 
  pron:  1114 1076 
  card:    40   36 
  ord :     3    3 
  adjt:   134  122 
  V   :   906  822 
  I   :  1905 1905 (no analysis required)

 total:  8609 8433 (97%)

 The total summary indicates a high percentage of agreement (97%). Earlier
 runs of the program pointed out numerous differences attributed to ejf 
 program errors which were corrected. So the process of making the 
 comparisons improved the quality of the ejf program code.
 Subsequent sections of this document discuss the details, in particular
 where  disagreement remains. Some disagreements are due to residual
 limitations in ejf algorithms, some to typographical mistakes in 
 'MbhRamaGrammar.rtf', and the rest to other causes.


* Mbhu-validate2 "noun" : possible Mbh typographical errors

DIFF @line 372: paricArikAH f2p paricAraka noun  [paricArika?]
  Would be understood if base were 'paricArika'; Apte has both bases
  (as well as 'paricArin').

DIFF @line 932: devaH m2s deva noun  [m1s]

DIFF @line 1208: rAjyaBAk m1s rAjyaBaj noun ctp upapada 2.2.19  [base=rAjyaBAj]
  in MW, 'rAjyaBAj' = "kingdom-possessor", a king.

DIFF @line 3170, 3907:   mAlyavat pn
 These two line have empty 'inflected form' and 'analyis'  fields 
 in Mbh file.

DIFF @line 3563: SilAtala n7s SilAtala noun ctp6  [SilAtale]
  Explected 'SilAtale' for n7s, or else n8s

DIFF @line 3610: bAlAm f1s bAlA noun  [f2s]

DIFF @line 6066: atikAyena m3p atikAya n ctp pràdi 2.2.18 [90]  [m3s]

DIFF @line 6603: SastraBftAm m3p SastraBft noun ctp upapada 2.2.19  [m6p]
DIFF @line 8214: SastraBftAm m3p SastraBft noun ctp upapada 2.2.19
  Possible explanatory forms would be (n6p f6p m6p).

DIFF @line 8107: arTamAnAByAm m2d arTamAna noun cdi  [m/f/n3/4/5d]


* Mbhu-validate2 "noun" : other differences

DIFF @line 403: ekEkasyAH f6s ekEka noun  [pron?]
DIFF @line 5770: gaRAneke m1p gaRAneka noun ctp6  [pron?]
  These two forms are understood if the declension follows that
  of the pronoun 'eka'. Is the lexical specification of 'noun' correct?

DIFF @line 2256: gfDrarAjAnam m2s gfDrarAja noun ctp6  [gfDrarAjan?]
DIFF @line 3800: rAjarAjAnam m2s rAjarAja noun ctp6  [rAjarAjan?]
 In both cases, declension would have been understood if citation
  ended in 'rAjan'. Which citation is correct?

DIFF @line 4562: BavitrI f1s Bavitf agent noun  [?]
  To explain this form, I classify it as an
  adjective ending in 'f', acc. to Antoine (vol I, p. 55);
  I am not sure if this difference is material.
  Deshpande (p. 115) says that agent nouns in 'f' always have the
  affix 'I' in feminine, and are then declined like 'nadI'. 
  
DIFF @line 4954: vAnaramuKyAnAm m6p vAnaramuKya noun ctp6
DIFF @line 7980: devaganDarvaBoginAm m6p devaganDarvaBogin noun cdi
DIFF @line 8195: mAnuzAsuraBoginAm m6p mAnuzAsuraBogin noun cdi
  (OK: EJF PROB):
  These are all cases where ejf logic expects 'ARAm' , but the preceding
  'r' does not cause this change due to being in a separate compound element.
  At the present, ejf logic simulates this rule in some circumstances, but
  is incomplete.  At present, ejf does not see how the presumed algorithm
  can be programmed.

Additional question:
@line 158/4632: vihAyasA m/n3s vihAyas noun
 I had first thought this was like 'jyAyas', a comparative in 'Iyas'.
 However, I think now it is declined with 1 stem.
  [vihAyAH vihAyasO vihAyasaH 
   vihAyasam vihAyasO vihAyasaH 
   vihAyasA vihAyoByAm vihAyoBiH  ....]
 Are the various adjectives ending in 'DAyas' also declined with 1 stem?

* Mbhu-validate2 "adj" : other differences

 NOTE: items shown as 'int adj, dem adj, rel adj' in Mbh, are
  not considered here, but under (Mbhu-validate2 "pron").

DIFF @line 270: svayamBUH m1s svayaMBU adj ctp upapada 2.2.19 [svayaMBUH]
  I am uncertain what alternate spellings are permitted with 'M'.
  For instance, are 'svayamBUH' and 'svayaMBUH' considered equally valid
  alternate spellings?  Why was the base given with 'M' and the inflected
  form with 'm'?  In general, how does one deal with such alternates in
  computer analysis of digitized documents?
DIFF @line 1956: BIru fvs BIru adj  [BIro = m/fvs, BIru = nvs ?]

DIFF @line 3790: brahmayoniH m1s brahmayoni adj cbv [brahmayoRiH] (ejf n-R err)

 misc differences, resolution undecided:
DIFF @line 7403: maGonaH m6s maGavat adj [per Kale#119, ejf has base 'maGavan']
DIFF @line 8157: samam n1s sama adj  [ejf classifies as 'pron'(pronominal adj)]

 There were several (79) instances where ejf logic did not recognize the
 inflection as an adjective, but did recognize it as a noun.
 Is it ok to think  of these as immaterial differences?
 Here are the instances:

* Mbhu-validate2 "pron" : other differences

 The forms of 'Atman' are identified by ejf logic when the lexical 
 category is 'noun'. Thus differences were noted for the 12 cases
 were the lexical category was given as 'reflexive pron'. 
 I am unsure whether the difference is material.

 'enad': I can not find 'enad' cited in MW; MW shows entry for 'ena', but
  not exactly as a root.  In Antoine, 'enam' forms are listed as alternates
  for 'idam' (p. 63, vol I). In Deshpande, they are alternates of 'etad' 
  (p. 76). Evidently, some grammarians also consider 'enad'  a word. 
  I am unsure whether the difference is material.

 Question on "mad" and "tvad":  Mbh has singular citations of 1st
 and 2nd personal pronouns as "mad" and "tvad", with plurals using
 "asmad" and "yuzmad".  ejf uses only "asmad" and "yuzmad". I
 suspect this difference is not material.

* Mbhu-validate2 "adjt" (prap) : other differences

 The following differences are due to insufficient specification
 information. According to my understanding, the class of the
 underlying root is needed in order to correctly form the present
 active participle; in particular this is needed to form the base
 for the feminine.  Most of the forms in Mbh were from roots of
 class 1, and so were viewed to be analyzed correctly. However, the
 following form the feminine without the 'n'.  
 Does this suggest the need for some modification of the description of
 'prap' items in Mbh?

DIFF @line 1216: biBratI f1s biBrat prap  strength=VW
DIFF @line 1969: prarudatI f1s prarudat prap  strength=W
DIFF @line 2177: rudatIm f2s rudat prap   strength=W

DIFF @line 3823: rudatyAH f6s rudat prap   strength=W
DIFF @line 4602: satI f1s sat prap   strength=W

 misc difference:
DIFF @line 3742: aBivarzatI f1s aBivarzat prap   
 In this case, I think the underlying root is 'vfz', which is class 1;
 this would then imply a feminine of 'aBivarzantI'. Thus, I can not
 explain this form.

DIFF @line 3812: prArudat 3sa ipf pra%rud vi2a [vi6a ?]
 I guess this is supposed to be ok, but it confuses me.
 The inflection can be explained by assuming the root to be of class 6.
 MW only lists class 2, and mentions the 'rudati' form as optional.
 Whitney mentions this form as a class 6 form.
 Why doesn't one use an alternate conjugational class
 to indicate this alternate conjugational form?

DIFF @line 6898: rejatuH 3da prf %raYj vi1/4am  [%rAj]
 NOTE: Acc. to Whitney, 'raYj' does not have a base 'rej' in perfect,

DIFF @line 5880: AnarcCat 3sa ppf %f v1a
  Whitney shows 'AnarCat' as a form of perfect ('prf').
  But note on Whitney: for 'gam' he shows 'gachati'; is the translation
  to SLP 'gacati'? I think the common form is 'gacCati'. So I have
  confusion over Whitney's transliteration.
  I don't understand either as a regular or periphrastic perfect.

DIFF @line 7641: AnarcuH 3pa prf %arc vt10am
  NOTE1: Whitney gives 'fc' with 'f', so 'AnarcuH' would be explained by
   that; however, class 10 is not one of the forms of 'f' in Whitney.

  NOTE2: 'prf' thought not to be appropriate for class 10 verbs, usually:
  ; Antoine#106 The reduplicative perfect is common to all
  ; monosyllabic roots beginning with a consonant or with
  ; 'a', 'aa', or short 'i', 'u', or 'Ri'
  ; The periphrastic perfect is used with roots beginning
  ; with a long vowel (other than 'aa') and with roots of
  ; the 10th conjugation and other derivative roots.
  ; The roots 'day' (to pity), 'kaas' (to cough),
  ; 'aas' (to sit) take the periphrastic perfect.
  ; The roots 'uurNu' (to cover) and 'RichCh' (to go) take
  ; the reduplicative perfect
  ; The roots 'uSh' (to burn), 'vid' (to know), 'bhii' (to fear),
  ; 'bhRi' (to support), 'hRi' (to take away), 'hrii' (to blush),

 NOTE: Whitney only has class 1, but both 'krAmati' and 'kramati',

 My understanding of how imperfect works with prefixes would imply,
 for instance, 'aByasiYcatAm' rather than 'aByaziYcatAm'; this only
 relevant in the imperfect where the 'a' of imperfect would, in my
 understanding, serve to retain the 's' of the root. For other tenses,
 the 'i' ending of the prefix would cause a change
 of the root initial 's' to 'z'; e.g., for imperative 'pratizeDayatu'.

 Does the 's' really change to 'z' in the imperfect? If so, is it true
 for any prefix ending in a vowel other than 'a A', and is 's' the only
 relevant initial root consonant? For instance,
 is it 'anvazeDayat' for 'anu%siD' and 'anvazidat' for 'anu%sad' ?

  NOTE re ejf code: provisionally have changed logic to recognize the
 above.

* rAmopAKyAna notes - begun 06-25-04
** janamejaya
 The name of the king to whom %{vESampAyana} recited the %{mahABArata}.
 The word is a compound %{janam-ejaya}, where %{ejaya} forms irregular 
 compounds with a preceding word in case 2.  %{ejaya} is related to the
 causal of the root %{ej} (class 1a), meaaning to stir, move, tremble, shake.
 Thus %{janamejaya} may mean " causing men to tremble ".
 By the way, %{vESampAyana} is, in epic poetry, a pupil of %{vyAsa}

**kfzRA
 The name of %{drOpadI}, wife of the %{pARqu} princes.
 The third book of the %{mahABArata} is called %{drOpadI-haraRa}, meaning
 " the forcible abduction of %{drOpadI}".
