root
 cpus  (list of (class pada (upasargas)))

root-classpada (or) root-classpada-upasarga1-...-upasargan (or)
 Eng-def
 conj-base  
  value is either 
   - a symbol, representing the conjugational base
   - a list of symbols, representing optional conjugational bases (rare)
   - a list with two elements, whose first is the symbol 'REF' and
     whose second is the symbol 'root-classpada' whose 'conj-base'
     will provide the value.  Note, this form is only used when
     there are upasargas present.
 NOTE 1: This value is present only in the case of conjugational classes
    1,4,6,10 (the 'a' classes). In the other classes, the conjugation
    is less regular.
 NOTE 2a: The file 'dhaatukosha.txt' provides specification of allowed
    class-pada-upasargas for a given root, along with definitions.
