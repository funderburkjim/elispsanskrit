Notes from Kale, Antoine, etc., from which the grammatical algorithms derive

* gerundive
 Other terms: potential participle
** general
*** Kale 711.
   The Potential Participle is formed by means of the affixes
   'tavya anIya ya' and rarely 'elim', added to a root or 
   derivative verb.  This is Passive when the verb is transitive, 
   and impersonal when the verb is intransitive.  It is also used
   like an adjective when denoting fitness, etc.
*** Kale 712. tavya, anIya
  The affixes 'tavya anIya' are added to roots or derivative bases
  in the sense of 'must be, fit to be, etc.'. 
  Before 'tavya' or 'anIya', the ending vowel and the 
   penultimate short vowel of a root take their guNa substitute.
  Before 'tavya', 'seT' roots take 'i', 'aniT' roots do not, and
   'veT' roots take it optionally.
  Before 'anIya', penultimate 'Ri' is always changed to 'ar', 
   and not to 'r' (as it sometimes does).
*** Kale 713.  anIya with derivative roots
  The final 'ay' of roots of the 10th class is dropped before 'anIya'.
  The final 'ay' of causals  is dropped before 'anIya'.
  The final 'a' of Atmanepadi Frequentative Bases, when the 'ya' is
   preceded by a vowel,  is dropped before 'anIya'.
  The final 'ya' of Atmanepadi Frequentative bases, when the 'ya' is
   preceded by a consonant, is dropped before 'anIya'.
  To Desiderative bases, 'anIya' is added without any change.
** 'yat' ya affix 
*** Kale 714. 'ya' to roots ending in vowel
  The affix 'ya' ('yat') is added on to roots ending in a vowel in the
  sense of 'fit for, fit to be, ought to be'.
  Before this 'ya', the radical vowel undergoes guNa substitute.
  Before this 'ya', final 'aa' (and 'e ai o' changeable to 'aa') is
   changed to 'e'
*** Kale 715. 'ya' to roots with penultimate 'a'
  Roots having 'a' for their penultimate and ending in a consonant of
  the labial class take the affix 'ya':
   'shap' -> shapya, labh -> labhya, ram -> ramya
*** Kale 716.
  The roots 'tak' (to laugh at), 'shas' (to kill), 'chat' (to look for,
  to ask), 'yat' (to strive), 'jan', 'shak', and 'sah' take the affix
  'ya'.
*** Kale 717.
  The roots 'gad mad char yam' take the affix 'ya' when not preceded by
  a preposition, or when preceded by the preposition 'aa'.
  Note: 'aa' with 'char' takes 'ya' provided the meaning is NOT 'preceptor'
  'aa' with 'char' takes 'Nyat' (becoming 'aachaarya') when meaning
  'preceptor'.
*** Kale 718.
  Some roots, when having certain meanings, take 'ya':
  - 'vad' when implying reproach; otherwise 'kyap'
  - 'paN' meaning 'to transact business'; otherwise 'Nyat'
  - 'vRi' 9 A , not denoting limit or restraint; otherwise 'kyap'
*** Kale 719.
  - 'vah', when not denoting an instrument for carrying, takes 'ya';
     otherwise, 'Nyat'
  - 'Ri' in the sense of 'a master or a Vaishya' takes 'ya';
     otherwise, 'Nyat'
*** Kale 720.
  - 'sRi' with 'upa' in the sense of 'being conceived' takes 'ya';
    otherwise 'sRi' with 'upa' takes 'Nyat'
*** Kale 721.
  - 'jRI' with the negative particle 'a' and qualifying 'saMgataM' 
    (friendship) takes 'ya'.
    When qualifying something else, it takes the affix 'tRi'
     (ajaritaa kambalaH : new blanket)
*** Kale 722.
  - 'han' takes the affix 'yat' optionally, before which 'vagh' is
    substituted for it: 'han' + 'ya' = 'vaghya' (what ought to be killed).
  - 'han' optionally takes 'Nyat', in which case 'ghaat' is 
    substituted for it: 'han' + 'Nyat' = 'ghaatya'
** kyap (ya)
*** Kale 723. The following roots take the affix 'kyap (ya)' in the
  same sense as 'yat':
  - the root 'i' (1,2 P) (to go)
  - roots 'stu shaas vRi' (5 P)
  - roots 'dRi juSh'
  - roots having 'Ri' for their penultimate, except 'kRip chRit'
  When a root ends in a short vowel, 't' is inserted between the final
  vowel and the affix 'ya': e.g., 
   - 'i' -> 'itya' (worthy of being approached)
   - 'stu' -> 'stutya' (deserving praise)
   - 'shaas' -> 'shiShya' (fit to be instructed)
   - 'vRit' -> 'vRitya' 
   - 'juSh' -> 'juShya' (worthy of being served)
   - 'vRidh' -> 'vRidhya' (fit to be increased as wealth)
*** Kale 724.
  According to Vaamana, the roots 'shams duh guh' take this affix optionally.
  - 'shaMs' -> 'shasya' (praiseworthy)
  - 'duh' -> 'duhya'
  - 'guh' -> 'guhya'
  Optionally, they take the affix 'Nyat':
  - 'shaMs' -> 'shaMsya'
  - 'duh' -> 'dohya'
  - 'guh' -> 'gohya'
*** Kale 725. 
  'mRij' takes this affix optionally:
   'mRijya' (wheat is fit or ought to be cleansed.
  Optionally, it takes 'Nyat', before which the final 'j' is changed to 'g':
   'maargya'
*** Kale 726(a)
  'bhuu', when it has a Subanta prefixed to it and is without a 
   preposition takes the affix 'kyap' impersonally:
    'brahmaNo bhaavaH' -> 'brahmabhuuyam' (identity with Brahman)
  When no Subanta is used prepositionally with 'bhuu', it takes
  the affix 'yat': 'bhavya'
*** Kale 726(b)
  'vad' under similar circumstances takes either 'kyap' or 'Nyat' in
  a passive sense or impersonally:
  'vadya' (kyap) ('brahmavadyam' = expounding the Veda)
  'udya' (Nyat) ('brahmodyam' = expounding the Veda)
*** Kale 727. 'khan' takes 'kyap', but drops its 'n' and adds 'ii' to
  its penultimate vowel:
  khan + ya = kha + ya = kha + ii + ya = khe + ya = kheya (what is fit
    or ought to be dug or excavated)
*** Kale 728. 'bhRi' (class 1) takes this affix when the participle so
  derived does not form a name:
    'bhRitya' (those who ought to be nourished or maintained = servants)
  'bhRi' takes 'Nyat' when a name is meant:
    'bhaarya' = 'bhRi' + 'Nyat' (a class of Kshatriyas)
  When 'sam' precedes 'bhRi', either of 'kyap' or 'Nyat' is added optionally:
   'saMbhRitya' , 'saMbhaarya'
  Note: the word 'bhaaryaa' (a wife) ought to be derived from 'bhRi'
   of the 3rd class and affix 'Nyat'
*** Kale 729. The following 7 words are irregularly formed with the affix
  'kyap' in the sense given in each case:
  - 'raajabhuuyaH' (raajan + bhuu + kyap)
  - 'suuryaH' (sRi + kyap) or (suu (6 P) + kyap)
  - 'mRiShodya' (mRiShaa + vad + kyap) = falsehood
  - 'kupyam' (any base metal) from 'gup + kyap' (??)
  Note: 'gup' in other cases takes the affix 'Nyat':
   'gup' + 'Nyat' = 'gopya' (what ought to be concealed)
  - 'pachya' (pach + kyap) (growing in cultivated ground)
  - 'avyathya' = 'a + vyath + kyap' (not feeling pain)
*** Kale 730(a)
  The following two words, which are the names of two rivers,
  are derived by means of the affix 'kyap':
  - 'bhinatti kuulaM bhidyaH' from 'bhid + kyap'
  - 'ujjhatyudakaM ujjhyaH' from 'ujjh + kyap'
*** Kale 730(b)
  Similarly, the words 'puShyaH' and 'sidhyaH', both the names of the
  constellation Pushya, are derived from 'puSh' and 'sidh' respectively
  with the affix 'kyap'
*** Kale 731.
  The roots 'puu nii ji', preceded by 'vi', take 'kyap' when the are
  connected with the words 'mu~nja kalpa hala', respectively:
  - vipuuyo mu~njaH : the Munja grass to be prepared for weaving into a rope
  - niniiyaH kalkaH : sin which ought to be destroyed
  - jityo haliH : the plough to be pulled with great force
*** Kale 732.
  The following words are derived from the root 'grah' with affix 'kyap':
  - 'avagRihyam', 'pragRihyam' : two technical terms in grammar
  - 'gRihyakaaH' : birds restrained from free motion, such as parrots
  - 'graamagRihyaa senaa' : an army stationed outside a village
  - 'aaryagRihyaH' : siding with the noble
*** Kale 733. 
  The roots 'kRi' and 'vRi' take both 'kyap' and 'Nyat':
  'kRitya', 'kaarya' : what ought to be done
  'vRiShya', 'vaarya' (not sure of 1st)
*** Kale 734.
  The root 'yuj' in the sense of 'to be harnessed' takes the affix 'kyap'
  and changes its final to 'g':
  'yugyaH gauH' : a bull to be harnessed to the yoke
  In other senses, it takes the affix 'Nyat': yojya
** Nyat (ya)
*** Kale 735. 
  Roots ending in 'Ri' and those ending in a consonant take the affix
  'Nyat' ('ya') in the same sense as 'yat'.
  Before this affix,
   - the ending 'ch' of a root is changed to 'k'
   - the ending 'j' of a root is changed to 'g'
   - the final vowel and the penultimate 'a' take vrddhi
   - any penultimate vowel but 'a' generally takes guna.
  Examples:
   - 'kRi' -> 'kaarya' : what ought to be done
   - 'dhRi' -> 'dhaarya' : what ought to be worn
   - 'grah' -> 'graahya' : what ought to be held
   - 'dabh' -> 'daabhya' : what ought to be impelled
   - 'vach' -> 'vaakya' : what is arranged, a sentece
   - 'pach' -> 'paakya' : what is to be cooked

*** Kale 736.
  The root 'vas', when preceded by 'amaa' (with) takes the affix 'Nyat'
  before which the penultimate 'a' is optionally changed to vrddhi.
  'amaavasyaa' or 'amaavaasyaa': the day on which the sun and moon
    are with each other, i.e., are in conjunction (e.g. eclipse?)
  The root 'sRij' when preceded by 'paaNi' or the preposition 'samava'
  takes 'Nyat': 'sargya'
*** Kale 737(a)
  The roots 'yaj yaach ruch pravach tyaj pach' do not change
  their final consonant to 'k' or 'g' before 'Nyat'.
   e.g. yaajya, yaachya, rochya, pravaachya, archya, tyaajya, paachya
  Note 1: 'archya' must come from 'Rich' (praise, shine)
  Note 2: In #735, 'pach' is shown as 'paakya', so both forms must be ok.
*** Kale 737(b)
  - 'vach' does not change its 'ch' to 'k' before 'Nyat' when the meaning
     is 'what ought to be spoken out, speech' : vaachya
  - 'vach' changes its 'ch' to 'k' otherwise: 'vaakyam' (a sentence)
*** Kale 737(c)
  - 'va~nch' -> 'va~nchya' when it means 'to go'
  - 'va~nch' -> 'va~Nkya' when it means 'to bend'
*** Kale 737(d)
  - 'yuj' when it is preceded by 'pra' and 'ni' takes the affix 'Nyat'
    in the sense of 'what is possible or capable of',
    and does not change its 'j' to 'g'
*** Kale 737(e)
  - 'bhuj' -> 'bhojyam' (food)
  - 'bhuj' -> 'bhogya' (what is fit to be enjoyed)
*** Kale 738.

  'what ought to or must necessarily be done'.
  - 'luu' -> 'laavyam' (what must necessarily be cut off)
  - 'suu' (with 'aa') -> 'saavyam'
  - 'yu' -> 'yaavya' (to mix)
*** Kale 738(a)
  The roots 'vap rap lap bhap chap' also do the same:
  - 'vap' -> 'vaapya' (what must necessarily be sown)
  - 'rap' -> 'raapya' (what must be spoken of distinctly)
  - 'lap' -> 'laapya'
  - 'bhap' -> 'bhaapya'  (could not find this root)
  - 'chap' -> 'chaapya'
*** Kale 739. The following words are irregularly derived by means of
  the affix 'Nyat':
  - aanaayyaH : (aa nii + Nyat) : what ought to be brought from the
    Gaarhapatya, ie, the Dakshinaagni
    But 'aaneya' in other cases.
  - praNaayyaH : (pra nii + Nyat) : a jar, disgusted with worldly pleasures ??

* prap
 present participle active (parasmaipada) voice
; Note: AntoineI-#83 says
; (1) Verbs taking parasmaipada terminations form their present
;   participle active in 'at'. To form it, the termination
;   'anti' of the 3rd pers. plur of the present active is
;   replaced by 'at'.
; (2) Verbs taking atmanepada terminations form their present
;   participle active in 'maana'. To form it, the termination
;   'te' of the 3rd pers. sing. of the present tense is replaced
;   by 'maana'.
; (2) is correct only for the a-conjugations.
; For the non-a conjugations, the ending 'aana' replaces the
; termination 'ate' of the 3rd pers. PLURAL of the present tense.
; An equivalent alternate of (2) for the 'a' conjugations is
; to replace the termination 'nte' of the 3rd pers. plur.
; of the present tense with 'maana'.
; Since the 3rd pers PLURAL of the present tense can be made
; to work with either, and is required for non-a conjugations,
; that is chosen for both a and non-a conjugations
; This is consistent with Goldman (weak stem of non-a conjugations)
; and Kale (#669, p. 418) says to use 3P of present tense.

* prmp
 present participle middle (atmanepada) voice
 Kale 669 (p. 418)
 The participle of the present atm. is formed by adding 'Ana' to the 
 root which undergoes the same changes before it, as before the termination
 'ate' or 'ante' of the 3rd pl. pre; 'Ana' is changed to 'mAna', in the
 case of roots of classes 1,4,6 and 10, and all derived roots, or rather
 when the base ends in 'a', before which the 'a' of the base remains
 unchanged. e.g. 
   'eD' (cl. 1) 'eDamAna' (growing)
   'vand' (cl. 1) 'vandamAna' (saluting)
   'SI' (cl. 2) 'SayAna' (lying down)
   'dviz' (cl. 2) 'dvizAna'  (hating)
   'han' with prefix 'A' (cl. 2) 'AGnAna' (killing)
   'DA' (cl. 3) 'daDAna' (holding)
   'div' (cl. 4) 'dIvyamAna' (playing)
   'su' (cl. 5) 'sunvAna' (extracting)
   'tud' (cl. 6) 'tudamAna' (giving pain)
   'ruD' (cl. 7) 'runDAna' (obstructing)
   'kf'  (cl. 8) 'kurvARa' (doing)
   'tan' (cl. 8) 'tanvAna' (stretching)
   'krI' (cl. 9) 'krIRAna' (buying)
   'cur' (cl. 10) 'corayamAna' (stealing)
   'buD' (cl. 1 c) 'boDayamAna' (causing to know)
   'buD' (cl. 1 d) 'buboDizamARa' (being desirous to know)
 Kale 670.
  (a) The 'A' of 'Ana' is changed to 'I' in the case of the
    root 'As' (cl. 2, to sit): AsIna
    Note: from MW, the form 'AsAna' is also found

* ppp
; Construction of the past passive participle
; based upon Kale, p. 421-431.
 Past Passive Participles.
 Kale 679. The Past Passive Participle is formed by the addition
  of the affix 'ta' to the root.
 Kale 680. Roots capable of taking samprasaarana take it before
  the affix 'ta'.
 Kale 682. The penultimate radical nasal is generally dropped.
  NOTE: Kale 584 gives a list, which is used
 Kale 683. The augment 'i' may be prefixed to 'ta'
 Kale 684. As a general rule, the following roots do not insert 'i':
   all roots ending in a vowel which are 'veT' and
   all roots ending in a consonant which are 'aniT'.
 Kale 685. 'seT' roots (subject to 684) generally admit of 'i'
  All derived roots admit of 'i'
  Roots of the 10th class reject their final 'ay'.
    NOTE: The root undergoes the 10th class conjugational changes
  Causals reject their final 'ay'.
  Parasmaipada Frequentatives reject their final 'a'.
  Atmanepada Frequentatives reject their final 'y'
 Kale 696(a)
  Roots ending in a nasal lengthen their penultimate vowel before
  - a weak termination  beginning with any consonant
    (except a nasal or a semivowel)
  - the affix 'kvip'. 
  e.g., 'sham' -> 'shaanta', 'kram' -> 'kraanta'
 Kale 696(b)
  The following roots drop their final nasal before
  a weak termination  beginning with any consonant
    (except a nasal or a semivowel).
  - 'aniT' roots ending in a nasal,
  - 'the root 'van' (1P),
  - the eight roots of the 8th class ending in 'n'
  - some others (see p. 354)
 Kale 697.
  The roots 'khan jan and san' drop their nasal and at the same time
  lengthen their vowel.

* Roots in 'e' (Kale)
 Kale-459 
  (one of sections beginning 'general or non-conjugational tenses ans moods',
   so applicable to many formations)
 Roots ending in 'e', 'ai', and 'o' are to be treated as
  roots ending in 'aa'. 
  Also the roots 'mi' (5 U to throw), 'mii' (9 U to kill), and
  'vii' (4 A to perish) is treated as a root ending in 'aa'
  before a termination causing guna or vrddhi.
 The root 'lii (9 U 4 A to adhere) changes its vowel to 'aa'
  before a termination causing guna or vrddhi.

* 'samprasaaraNa'
 Kale 502, p. 308
  The change of a semivowel to its corresponding vowel is called
  'samprasaaraNa'.  SamprasaaraNa generally takes place before 
  weak terminations in the case of the following roots:
  vach yaj vap vah
  vas (to dwell)
  ve vye hve shvi
  vad svap jyaa vash vyach prachCh vrashch bhrasj grah and vyadh.
  In the case of the Perfect, the roots 'prachCh vrashCh and bhrasj'
  form an exception.

* participles in 'at'
 Kale 116(a). Participial bases ending in 'at'.
  The declension of these does not differ from that of nouns in 'mat'
  except in the Nom. sing. mas. in which the 'a' of 'at' is not lengthened.
  In the case of the dual of the Nom. Voc. and Acc. neuter, 'n' is
  inserted before the final 't':
  - necessarily in the case of
    -- the present participles of the roots of classes 1,4 and 10
    -- the present participles of causal, desiderative, and nominal verbs
  - optionally in the case of
    -- the present participles of the roots of class 6
    -- the present participles of roots of class 2 ending in 'aa'
    -- the future participles (in 'syat' or 'Shyat')
  - Not at all in the case of the remaining participles of the present tense
  The Feminine of these ends in 'ii', being the same as the Neuter dual of
  the Nom., and has no declensional peculiarities.
 Kale 116(b)
  'n' is NOT inserted at all in the case of the participles of 
  the present of 
   - roots of the 3rd class
   - the Parasm. frequentative
   - the participles
     -- shaasat 
     -- jakShat
     -- chakaasat
     -- daridrat
     -- jaagrat
     -- diivyat
     -- devyat.
   In the case of the Nom. Voc. and Acc. plu. neu, however, it is
    optionally inserted.
  NOTE (09-27-03): I have not implemented this last exception, e.g.,
    see (sanget2 'x '(dhaatu PRESPART)) for x = daa-3P, jaagRi-2P, etc.

* pft, fut, con, ben
** naming conventions
 from file 'gram2-future.el'
; Based upon Antoine, volume 2 and Kale
; code for the following:
;  1. pft = periphrastic future = First future = luT
;  2. fut = simple future = second future = lRiT
;  3. con = conditional = lRi~N
;  4. ben = benedictive = aashiirli~N
** two futures (Antoine)
 Antoine2#132. There are two forms of the future in Sanskrit:
   1. The periphrastic future (luT) which expresses remote future events.
   2. The simple future (lRiT) which expresses any future event, whether
      immediate or remote.
** pft (Antoine)
  Antoine2#135. The periphrastic future (luT).
   1. A verbal noun formed with the suffix 'tRich' in the nom. masc. sing.
      is prefixed to the the present tense of the auxiliary 'as' in the
      1st and 2nd persons.  In the 3rd person, the verbal noun is not 
      followed by the auxiliary and takes the forms of the nom. sing., dual.
      and plur. masc: -taa -taarau -taaraH
   2. The final vowel and the short medial vowel of the verbal roots
     take guna.  The verbs of the 10th conjugation keep the base of the
     present tense. The result may be called the verbal base.
   3. To the verbal base is added 'i', necessarily, optionally, or not at
     all, depending on whether the root is 'seT', 'veT', or 'aniT'.
     To this is added the ending as describe in 1.
** pft (Kale)
 Kale #468.
  The First Future (luT) is also called the periphrastic future.
  Its Parasmaipada terminations are:
    taa taarau taaraH
    taasi taasyaH taasya
    taasmi taasvaH tassmaH
  Its Atmanepada terminations are:
    taa taarau taaraH 
    taase taasathe taadhve 
    taahe taasvahe taasmahe
 Kale #469.
  To these terminations the augment 'i' 
    is prefixed in the case of 'seT' roots,
    is optionally prefixed in the case of 'veT' roots
    is not prefixed at all in the case of 'aniT' roots.
 Kale #470.
  All these terminations are strong.
  The final vowel and the penultimate short vowel of a root 
  therefore take their 'guNa' substitute before these.
 Kale #471.
  'aniT' roots with a penultimate 'Ri' change it to 'r' optionally
  before a strong termination beginning with any consonant except
  a nasal or a semi-vowel (in particular, before any of the terminations
  of the periphrastic future):
   sRip : sarptaasmi  sraptaasmi

  IRREGULAR BASES
 Kale #472.
  The following roots are 'veT' (admit 'i' optionally) in the First Future:
   iSh
   saH (1 A)
   lubh
   riSh

 Kale #473.
  The root 'kLip' is optionally parasmaipada in the First future, 
  and when so it is 'aniT' (rejects 'i').
 Kale #474.
  The augment 'i' as added to the root 'grah' is long (i.e., 'ii' is 
  added) in all non-conjugational tenses, except in the Perfect.
 Kale #475.
  The intermediate 'i' is optionally lengthened (i.e., 'ii' is added)
  in the case of 'vRi' and roots ending in (long) 'RI', except
  in the Perfect, the Benedictive atmanepada, and the Aorist parasmaipada.
  For example: 
    'vf' 'varitAsmi' or 'varItAsmi'
    'kF' 'karitAsmi' or 'karItAsmi'
 Kale #476.
  The root 'masj': This is an 'aniT' root. 
    'n' is inserted before the ending consonant and
    the  's' is dropped when they are followed by any consonant
    except a nasal or a semi-vowel. In particular this is applicable
    to all the periphrastic future forms:  ma~Nktaa.
    When the 'n' is not dropped, the 's' is changed to 'j': mamajja
  The root 'nash': This is a 'veT' root.
    'n' is inserted after the vowel when it is followed by an consonant
    except a nasal or a semi-vowel. In particular this is applicable
    to all the periphrastic future forms: naMShTaa or nashitaa
 Kale #477.
  The root 'aj'.
  The root 'vii' is substituted for the root 'aj' (1 P 'to go') 
    a. necessarily before any non-conjugational termination, and
    b. optionally before any such as begin with any consonant except 'y':
      First Future:  vetaa or ajitaa
      (another example)   veShyati ajiShyati
** fut and con (Kale)

 Kale 478. 
   NOTE: The endings for the Second Future (lRiT) are in file 'endings.el'.
  Kale 479.
   NOTE: The endings for the Conditional (lRi~N) are in file 'endings.el'.
  Kale 480.
   't' is substituted for the ending 's' of a root when followed by
   any non-conjugational termination beginning with 's'.
   NOTE: All terminations of lRiT and lRi~N begin with 's'
  Kale 481.
   'i' is to be prefixed, or not, or optionally in the terminations,
   according as the root is 'seT aniT or weT'.
   Before the terminations, the final vowel and the penultimate
   short vowel take their guna substitute.
  Kale 482.
   In the Conditional, the augment 'a' is prefixed to the root as
   in the imperfect.
 
** fut passive (Antoine)
 Antoine2#138. 
 The future passive is identical with the future atmanepada. Thus,
  'jyeShyati' = he will conquer
  'jyeShyate' = he will be conquered
 Roots ending with a vowel and the roots 'han', 'grah', and 'dRish'
 have an optional form in the future passive.
 1. The final vowel takes vrddhi
 2. a final 'aa' is changed to 'aay'
 3. 'han' changes to 'ghan', 
    'grah' changes to 'graah'
    'dRish' changes to 'darsh'
 4. 'i' is inserted, and the atmanepada terminations are added.
** fut passive (Kale)
 Kale 596(a)
   The forms of the two Futures, Conditional and the Benedictive
   of the Passive are made up in the same way as those of the Active,
   every root being supposed Atmanepadi.

  Kale 596(b)
   Roots ending in a vowel and the roots 'han grah dRish' optionally
   form the two Futures, the Conditional, and the Benedictive of the
   Passive by changing their vowel to 'vrddhi' and appending the 
   'A' terminations of those tenses with 'i' prefixed to them invariably.
   In the case of roots ending in 'aa' (and in 'e ai o' changeable to 'aa'),
   'y' is inserted between the root and this 'i'.
   Note:
    'nuu' and 'dhuu' take vrddhi in this case though it is usually
    forbidden with them.  See #463. 'dRish' takes 'guna' only.
** ben (Antoine)
  aashiirli~N = benedictive
 Antoine2#142, p. 94-6
 The Benedictive expresses a wish of the speaker or a blessing conferred
 by him on some other person.
 (1) Before parasmaipada terminations
  1. The verbal root is treated as in the passive voice
     (refer Antoine#1 68 and 71(3))
     with the 'y' of the passive being replaced by the terminations.
  2. Roots endinging in 'aa', 'e', 'ai', and 'o' change their final
     vowel to 
     a. 'e' when the preceding consonant is simple
     b. to 'aa' or 'e' when the preceding consonant is conjunct
 (2) Before atmanepada terminations
  1. 'i' is inserted in the case of 'seT' roots
     'i' is inserted optionally in the case of 'veT' roots
  2. The following roots are considered 'veT':
     a. Roots ending in 'Ri' and preceded by a conjunct consonant
     b. 'vRi'
     c. Roots ending in 'RI'
  3. When 'i' is inserted,
     the final vowel and the short medial vowel take guna.
  4. When 'i' is not inserted,
     (a) a short medial vowel remains unchanged
     (b) a final 'Ri' remains unchanged
     (c) a final 'RI' is changed to 'iir' after a non-labial
     (d) a final 'RI' is changed to 'uur' after a labial
  5. The inserted 'i' is lengthened for 'grah'.
** ben (Kale)
 aashiirli~N-doc-Kale
 Parasmaipada Benedictive
  580. The P terminations are weak and therefore occasion no
    guna or vrddhi change in the root.
    All roots reject the augment 'i'
  581. The following changes apply to roots both before
   the P terminations of the Benedictive, and before the 'y'
   of the (ordinary) passive.
   1. The final 'i' or 'u' is lengthened
   2. final 'Ri' is changed to 'ri'
   3. final 'RI' preceded by a non-labial is changed to 'iir'
   4. final 'RI' preceded by a labial or 'v' is changed to 'uur'
  582. 
   1. Final 'Ri' preceded by a conjunct consonant is changed
      to guna: 'smRi' -> smaryaat
   2. the  'Ri' of the root 'Ri' is changed to Guna: 'aryaat'
  583. 
   1. Roots capable of taking samprasaaraNa take it (see #502)
   2. 'shaas' substitutes 'i' for its vowel : 'shiShyaat'
  584. A penultimate nasal is generally dropped. Some of the roots
   dropping their nasal thus are:
   a~nch a~nj bha~nj ra~nj sa~nj sva~nj
   granth manth
   und skand syand
   indh bandh 
   dambh stambh
   daMsh bhraMsh sraMs tRiMh
  585. 
   1. Some roots change their final vowel to 'e':
     'daa', 'dhaa' and roots assuming these forms (???)
      'maa' , 'sthaa', 'gai',
      'paa' (to drink: 1P),
      'haa' (to abandon : 3)
   2. Final 'aa' (original or substituted - See #459), if it be
      preceded by a conjunct consonant, is changed to 'e' optionally:
      e.g. : glaa -> gleyaat or glaayaat
   3. paa (to protect: 2) does not change to 'e': paayaat
    
  Atmanepada Benedictive
  586.
   a. 'i' is prefixed to the terminations after 'seT' roots, and
      optionally after 'veT' roots
   b. Roots ending in 'Ri' preceded by a conjunct consonant,
      the root 'vRi', and roots ending in 'RI' admit 'i' optionally.
  587.
      The atmanepada terminations are strong. Before these,
      the radical vowel takes its guNa substitute, but when the
      intermediate 'i' is not prefixed to the terminations, the
      final 'Ri' remains unchanged, and 'RI' is changed to 'uur' if
      a labial or 'v' precedes, and to 'iir' otherwise. For instance:
       chi -> cheShiiShTa
       dhu -> dhoShiiShTa
       luu -> laviShiiShTa
       stRI -> stariShiiShTa or stiirShiiShTa
       pRI -> pariShiiShTa or puurShiiShTa
      NOTE: Kale actually says 'ur' and 'ir', but his examples, as
      well as the explanation in Antoine, make me think this is an
      error, and that actually 'uur' and 'iir' are meant.
** future participle (kale)
 Kale 709, p. 431
  The participle of the simple future, active as well as passive, is
  formed from the third person singular form of the Second Future of
  a root.  
  The Parasm. Ptc. is formed simply by dropping the final 'i'.
  The Atm. Ptc. is formed by substituting 'maana' for the final 'te'.
  The Passive Ptc. is formed by substituting 'maana' for the final 'te'.
 Kale 710.
  These participles are declined like words ending in 't' and 'a'.
  (The Par. Ptc. is declined like participles ending in 'at')
** future participle (Antoine)
 Antoine2#139, p. 92-3
 The future participles ('syatRi syamaana')
  The parasm. and atm. participles of the simple future are formed
  in the same way as the present participles of the 6th conjugation.
  The termination 'syanti' of the 3rd pers. plur. parasm. is replaced
  by 'syat'.
  The termination 'syante' of the 3rd pers. plur. atm. is replaced
  by 'syamaana'
 The declension of the future participle parasm is the same as that
  of verbs of the 6th conjugation, i.e., they optionally keep the
  'n' in their strong forms.
   - Masc: daasyan daasyat, daasyantau daasyatau, daasyantaH daasyataH
   - Neut: daasyat , daasyantii or daasyatii, daasyanti
   - Fem: either daasyantii or daasyatii.
 The future participle is often used in the sense of 'about to' or
  'going to': e.g.,
   - 'gamiShyan' about to go
   - 'ghaaniShyamaaNaa kanyaa' the girl about to be killed
 NOTE: This account differs from that of Kale in the Masculine for
  Parasm. future participle. Namely, Kale does not have the optional
  strong forms with an inserted 'n', e.g.,   'daasyat, daasyatau, daasyataH'.
  I think Antoine just made a mistake here, because his description of
  the present active participles of verbs of class 6 also does not have
  these alternate 'n' forms in the masculine (see Antoine1#83, p. 84).

  2. Optionally, an 'anusvaara' is further changed to a nasal consonant,
     which is homorganic with the following consonant.
  NOTE: An 'anusvaara' does not occur before a vowel or at the end of a

     before the consonants 'r sh Sh s h'. Before these it remains an
     'anusvaara'. Change of 'anusvaara' before 'y l v' is less common.

comm: Antoine(vol 1) Section 54
  Visarga standing for final 'r' follows the general rules of 
  visarga-sandhi (Antoine 27) with one exception:
  Visarga standing for final 'r', even when preceded by 'a' or 'aa', and
  followed by a vowel or a soft consonant, is changed to 'r'.
  The following tries to elaborate the actual cases; we are thinking
  of a word, like 'punar' or 'maatar' that ends in 'r'.

  Given any vowel + r + k kh p ph sh Sh s, then r becomes H
  Given any vowel + r + ch or Ch, then r becomes sh
  Given any vowel + r + T or Th, then r becomes Sh
  Given any vowel + r + t or th, then r becomes s
  Given any vowel  + r + vowel or soft cons. other than 'r', 
      then r is unchanged,
      AND the words are joined! e.g. punar + api -> punarapi
  Given any vowel v + r + r, then
    (a) v changes to its long form
    (b) first r is dropped
    (c) words are not joined

  When 's' is preceded by a vowel, except 'a' or 'aa', or by
  'k' or 'r', and is followed in the same word by 't', 'th',
  'm', 'y', 'v', or a vowel, then the 's' changes to 'Sh'. This
  also holds if there be an anusvaara or visarga between the
  preceding marker (vowel 'k' 'r') and the 's'.
  Addendum:
   If the following letter is 't', it is changed to 'T';
   If the following letter is 'th', it is changed to 'Th'

comm: Antoine(vol 1) Section 72 - rule 4
  (4) A final hard consonant becomes soft before a vowel or a soft consonant
  (5a) This rule does not apply to the final hard consonant of a verbal
       base or nominal stem followed by a termination or a case-ending
       beginning with a vowel or a semi-vowel.
  (5b) This rule does apply, however, to the final hard consonant of a verbal
       base or nominal stem followed by a termination or a case-ending
       beginning with a soft consonant other than a semi-vowel.
  Rule (4) and (5a) apply in both external and internal sandhi. For external
  sandhi, it appears optional whether the two words are joined or not. Thus,
  I enable both versions ('join' and 'nojoin')
prog: sandhi-cons72-6-init
args: nil
comm: Antoine(vol 1) Section 72 - rule 6
  (6) A soft consonant becomes hard before a hard consonant. 
  (7) This rule does not apply to the final soft aspirate of a
      verbal root followed by a termination beginning with 't' or 'th'.
      In that case, the final consonant of the root loses its aspiration
      and the 't' or 'th' is changed to 'dh.' e.g.,
      'labh' + 'ta' = 'labdha'
   Let 'cond1' denote the condition of a final soft aspirate followed
    by a 't' or 'th'.
   Let 'cond2' denote the other conditions 
   We use ref = Antoine72-6 for 'cond2'.
   We use ref = Antoine72-6a for 'cond1' when the soft consonant is 
    changed to a hard consonant.
   We use ref = Antoine72-7 for 'cond1' when the action of (7) is taken.
   Thus, to form the 'laT' etc for non-a conjugations, 
   we require that rules with ref = Antoine72-6a be skipped.
  This rule applies in both external sandhi and internal sandhi. For external
  sandhi, it appears optional whether the two words are joined or not. Thus,
  I enable both versions ('join' and 'nojoin')
